  MD_4017_KM.h - Library for CD4017 driven key switch matrix.
  
  Created by Marco Colli April 2014
	
  Small library to manage the keyswitch matrix managed by a 4017 as 
  described in the articles at 
  http://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4413677/Connect-a-4-3-matrix-keyboard-to-a-microcontroller-using-two-I-O-pins
  http://www.edn.com/design/components-and-packaging/4408027/Read-10-or-more-switches-using-only-two-I-O-pins-of-a-microcontroller
  
  The library
  - Allows definition of the size of the keyswitch matrix
  - Manages the scanning of the 4017 to read the matrix
  - Detects the transition from OFF state to ON state for each key
  - implements software enabled debounce and software auto repeat
  
  Using a 4017 IC, this library implements a method for reading many
  open/closed switches using only three digital I/O pins (Clock, Reset 
  and Data_in). 
  
  Diodes isolate the 4017 counter outputs in the event that two or more 
  switches are closed at the same time. The number of switches connected 
  can be increased by cascading multiple CD4017 or by using a matrix style 
  arrangement. Reliable operation following the initial power-up reset 
  depends on the CD4017 counterâ€™s remaining synchronized with the MCU 
  counter. The Reset pin I/O pin is needed for reliable operation but can 
  be omitted if desired.
  
  Refer to the articles above for a more detailed explanation of the circuit 
  to be implemented.
